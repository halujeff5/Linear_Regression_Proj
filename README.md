# National Park Trails Linear_Regression_Proj

The project was to predict the usage(popularity) of National Park Trails given some trail parameters. EDA concluded length, elevation, and type were important criteria in a trails popularity. This repo contains this readme, the final notebook and the csv file of my data. The Final_NB contains my EDA and regression analysis. There is also a presentation.pdf which is a slide summary highlighting key points of my analysis.
