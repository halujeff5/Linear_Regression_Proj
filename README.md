# Linear_Regression_Proj

The project was to predict the usage(popularity) of National Park Trails given some trail parameters. An EDA was done to encompass my findings about my dataset while getting to know it to extrapolate useful data for my prediction. This repo contains this readme, and 3 notebooks. The Final_NB is the actual notebook to view whereas the other two are slightly alternate versions. There is also a presentation.pdf which is a slide summary highlighting key points of my analysis. I have also included the dataset used for this project.
