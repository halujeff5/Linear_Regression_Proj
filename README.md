# National Park Trails Linear_Regression_Proj

The project was to predict the usage(popularity) of National Park Trails given some trail parameters. An EDA was done to encompass my findings about my dataset while getting to know it to extrapolate for useful data for my prediction. This repo contains this readme, the final notebook and the csv file of my data. The Final_NB contains my EDA and regressor. There is also a presentation.pdf which is a slide summary highlighting key points of my analysis.
